I recommend to use the testers that are in each project repository. Here I made some changes in some tests in order to use all the functions in the same library.

* [libft tester:]https://github.com/sgkhusal/42-libft)
* [get_next_line tester:](https://github.com/sgkhusal/42-GNL)
* [ft_printf tester:](https://github.com/sgkhusal/42-ft_printf)
